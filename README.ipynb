    "# Visualizing model performance with boxplots\n",
    "How to plot multiple boxplots in the same figure. Useful when we need to visualize the mean/median model performance, along with variability (standard deviation/interquantile range).\n",
    "Let us assume we have a number of trained models and we want to assess how they perform\n",
    "on the same intependent test set using a performance metric, such as accuracy, Dice, AUC, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent models\n",
    "When evaluating independent models it is useful to plot their performance as a \n",
    "boxplot. Boxplots are a convenient way to visualize the variability of a model's\n",
    "performance on a set of datapoints (that comprise the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we prefer a cleaner look, we can only plot the medians, along with error-bars\n",
    "that correspond to the 25th and 75th percentile (showing the interquantile range)\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of different models can be visualized via boxplots as\n",

    "**Figure 2** Visualizing the performance of independent models via median+error bars corresponding to the interquantile range (the 25th and 75th percentiles).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependent models\n",
    "Sometimes we want to visualize a series of dependent models. E.g. how the performance\n",
    "of a model changes after training for additional epochs, or after adding new datapoints\n",
    "to the training set. In this case, it is convenient to visualize this continuity\n",
    "by connecting the boxplots. In this example, we connect the boxplots by drawing a \n",
    "line that connects the medians\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can connect the medians of the cleaner plot that only visualizes\n",
    "the median and the interquantile range.\n",

    "**Figure 4** Visualizing the performance of dependent models via median+error bars corresponding to the interquantile range (the 25th and 75th percentiles).\n",

    "The plots are generated using artificial data. All plots are created in generate_plot.py.\n",
